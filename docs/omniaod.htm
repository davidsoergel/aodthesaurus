<h2><center>Preface  </center></h2>

The Alcohol and Other Drug Thesaurus:  A Guide to Concepts and Terminology in Substance Abuse and Addiction was developed under the auspices of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) to record and systematize the language of the many scientific and scholarly disciplines relating to research on alcohol and other drugs and the prevention and treatment of problems associated with their use.  A subset of the Thesaurus also serves as the controlled vocabulary for the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (commonly known as ETOH), produced by NIAAA, and the numerous information systems of CSAP's National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information.  <p>

<h2><center>History and Purpose of the Alcohol and Other Drug Thesaurus</center></h2>

Research in the alcohol and other drugs (AOD) field and programs in prevention and treatment have grown significantly over the last 20 years; so have the literature and the information needs of users and the collections and databases serving them.  This growth has occurred without the benefit of a stable, consistent vocabulary, making storage and retrieval of materials difficult.  Responding to a recommendation from SALIS (Substance Abuse Librarians and Information Specialists) for a thesaurus for the AOD field, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) undertook the task of developing an alcohol thesaurus for the field in general and its online database, the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (known as ETOH).  In 1989 NIAAA formed a Thesaurus Advisory Committee of information and subject specialists.  In 1991, recognizing the commonalities in research and prevention regardless of the specific drug, NIAAA entered into a joint project with the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP).  Thus, <i>The Alcohol and Other Drug Thesaurus:  A Guide to Concepts and Terminology in Substance Abuse and Addiction </i> (AOD Thesaurus) was born.<p>

The AOD Thesaurus provides a conceptual map of the multidisciplinary field of AOD research and practice, as well as standard terminology, which, over time, will result in consistent indexing and major improvements in searching and retrieval across many databases.  The Thesaurus is already used in indexing and searching both ETOH (reindexed all the way back) and the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI) databases.  The sponsoring organizations and the Advisory Committee hope that other databases will join as well to promote consistency and ease of use. The Thesaurus is also used by many searchers worldwide to identify useful search terms for any database. <p>



<h2><center>Thesaurus Development and Maintenance</center></h2>

Thesaurus development started with collecting terms and term relationships from many sources: search requests received for ETOH and NCADI databases; document titles and index terms; more than 40 special thesauri; and NIAAA's Reports to Congress on Alcohol and Health and other publications. Major sources used for reference and guidance include the World Health Organization's (WHO's) <i>Lexicon of Alcohol and Drug Terms</i>, developed jointly with NIAAA; NLM's <i>Medical Subject Headings (MESH)</i>; the <i>International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions</i>; the DSM-III and draft DSM-IV; the <i>Thesaurus of Psychological Indexing Terms</i> (PsyclNFO); the <i>Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors</i>; and the <i>Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms</i> (Sociological Abstracts).<p>

The multitude of terms collected from these sources were organized into hierarchies, which brought to the fore many synonyms and near-synonyms.  A conceptual analysis process known as semantic factoring further clarified the structure and led to a smaller vocabulary consisting of conceptual building blocks.  The resulting structure was thoroughly field-tested through a query formulation and indexing test.  Analyzing the results from multiple indexers for important terms missed, different indexers using different terms to express the same idea, terms assigned erroneously, and terms needed but missing from the Thesaurus, the developers identified areas requiring clarification, redundancies between areas, missing cross-references, the need for more or better scope notes, and areas where detail could be reduced.  Further refinements were made in this second edition based on indexing and searching experience:  Descriptors were added, overly specific descriptors were pruned, the structure was improved, and many scope notes and relationships were added.<p>


The sponsoring organizations are committed to the maintenance of 
the AOD Thesaurus as an ongoing process driven by user feedback.
Users are invited and strongly encouraged to comment on any aspect of the Thesaurus using the enclosed comment form or by e-mail to kmullen@prevline.health.org.<p>

<h2><center>Function and Structure of the Thesaurus</center></h2>

The Thesaurus presents a structured collection of concepts and terms intended to facilitate indexing and retrieval, support research and program planning through conceptual structure and definitions, and improve communication generally through standardized terminology.<p>

The Thesaurus provides guidance to the indexers for <b>request-oriented</b> (or <b>user-centered</b>) indexing.  The Thesaurus organizes concepts collected from search requests into an easily grasped hierarchical structure that serves as a framework or checklist in analyzing documents.  The logical structure of the Thesaurus communicates user interests to the indexer.  The Thesaurus' controlled vocabulary expresses each concept unambiguously through one term, called a <b>descriptor</b>, that is used in indexing and can thus be used with confidence in searching.  The Thesaurus leads from a synonym to the descriptor: early intervention leads to <b>JC6.2.4 secondary prevention</b>; chemical abuse, drug abuse, and substance abuse all lead to <b> GC2 AOD abuse</b>; nerve cell and neurocyte both lead to <b> XX2.2 neuron.</b><p>

The Thesaurus is also very useful for free-text searching (searching based on words in the title or abstract).  An exhaustive free-text search must include all terms that might be used to express the searched-for concept.  This requires <b>query term expansion</b>: In <b>synonym expansion</b>, expand the query term <b>XX2.2 neuron</b> by adding the synonyms nerve cell and neurocyte; in <b>hierarchic expansion</b>, add narrower terms, such as <b>XX2.2.2.4 dendrite</b> and <b>XX2.2.2.6 axon</b> (with its synonyms, such as nerve fiber and neurite).<p>

"Until further notice, everything is drug-related."  This note on a drug counselor's door epitomizes the universal scope of the AOD Thesaurus.  The Thesaurus must exercise great conceptual economy if it is to allow for the expression of most concepts and themes while keeping the size manageable.  The secret is <b>concept combination</b>; the Thesaurus contains largely elemental concepts from which compound concepts can be formed.  For example, alcohol craving is <b>AE6 AOD craving</b> combined with <b>BB2 ethanol</b>; nicotine craving uses <b>BD2 nicotine</b>, etc.  Thus any of the many concepts under <b>A AOD use, abuse, and dependence</b> can be combined with any of the substances under <b>B AOD substance or product</b>, obviating the need for enumerating each individual combination.  For another example, hepatoma is <b>GG20.26.4.4 carcinoma</b> and <b>GQ10 liver disorder</b>.<p>

The concepts are arranged in a logical hierarchy to orient the user, to help the indexer select the descriptor at the most appropriate level of specificity, and to enable hierarchic query term expansion.   An individual hierarchy is often structured into <b>facets</b>, each dealing with a separate aspect.  For example, under <b>XX2.2 neuron</b> are the two facets <b>XX2.2.2 neuron structure</b> (which includes the different parts of a neuron) and <b>XX2.2.4 neuron type</b> (including <b>afferent neuron</b>, <b>efferent neuron</b>, <b>motor neuron</b>, etc.).  Under <b>JB prevention</b> are the facets <b>JC prevention goals</b>, <b>JF prevention sponsor or setting</b> (such as <b>JF8 community-based prevention</b> and <b>JF10 institution-based prevention</b>, which is further subdivided by type of institution), and <b>JG prevention approach</b> (such as <b>JG12.4 prevention through information dissemination</b>, <b>JG12.8.4 skills building</b>, and <b>JG20.4 prevention through supply reduction</b>).  A descriptor (e.g., <b>GQ10.2 alcoholic liver disorder</b>) has as many broader descriptors as are needed to reflect reality (e.g., <b>GQ10 liver disorder</b> and <b>GD4 alcohol related disorder)</b>. These <b>polyhierarchical</b> relationships are shown through a rich network of cross-references.<p>

The construction of a hierarchy often profits from new concepts that improve organization and may be useful for searching.  For example, <b>JG12.8 prevention through personal development</b> groups <b>affective and interpersonal education</b>, <b>skills building</b>, <b>moral development</b>, and <b>values clarification</b>.  <b>HZ4 analytic psychotherapy</b> groups together all psychotherapeutic methods that are based on some form of analysis (as opposed to behavior modification through some form of conditioning).<p>
<h2><center> Terminology Used in the AOD Thesaurus</center></h2>

<b>Use of the Abbreviation <i>AOD</i></b><p>

The AOD Thesaurus uses the widely accepted abbreviation <i>AOD</i> for <i>Alcohol and/or Other Drugs</i>.  In most descriptors, <i>AOD</i> is used in place of <i>drug</i> or <i>substance</i>; thus, <i>drug dependence</i> becomes <b>AOD dependence</b>, and <i>substance abuse</i> becomes <b>AOD abuse</b>.  However, when only other drugs are referred to or when usage dictates, the term <i>drug</i> remains, as in <b>designer drug</b> or <b>drug cartel.</b><p>

In order to keep descriptors to a manageable length, further abbreviations were introduced as follows:<p>

	AOD		<b>A</b>lcohol or <b>O</b>ther <b>D</b>rugs
	AODU	<b>AOD U</b>se, abuse, and dependence
	AODD	<b>AOD</b> use <b>D</b>isorder
	AODR	<b>AOD R</b>elated
	AODC	<b>C</b>auses of <b>AOD</b> use, abuse, and dependence
	AODE	<b>E</b>ffects of <b>AOD </b>use, abuse, and dependence

These abbreviations appear at the bottom of each page in the Thesaurus listings.<p>

<h2><center>Use of the Term <i>Drug</i></center></h2>

The term <i>drug</i> is ambiguous; it can refer to AOD, medical drugs, or any chemical substance.  In this Thesaurus, <i>drug</i> refers to "other drug," that is, AOD other than alcohol, except in the pharmacology section, where it means any chemical substance </i>including</i> AOD.<p>

In the study of addiction, the terms <i>AOD</i>, <i>drug</i>, and <i>substance</i> are often used interchangeably.  As noted above, the Thesaurus uses <i>AOD</i> except where the reference is only to other drugs.  It was not practical to provide all possible variations of multiword terms; thus, the Thesaurus includes <b>hazardous AOD use</b> but does <b>not</b> include the synonym <i>hazardous drug use</i>.  When an alphabetical index search under <i>drug</i> does not find the looked-for term, try under <i>AOD</i>.  The access word <i>substance</i> has only a limited number of entries.<p>

<b>Street terms and slang</b>.  Due to profusion, overlap (e.g., <i>dope</i> can refer to marijuana or heroin), and the rapid disappearance of old terms and the creation of new ones, the AOD Thesaurus provides few street terms or slang terms with respect to alcohol and other drugs and their use.  (For a good reference see <i>Street Terms: Drugs and the Drug Trade</i>.  Office for National Drug Control (ONDCP), Drugs and Crime Clearinghouse. February 1995.  1-800-666-3332, askncjrs@ncjrs.aspensys.com)<p>

<b>Singular versus plural</b>.  As a rule, singular is preferred.  Exceptions are class descriptors in <b>W Living organisms</b> and <b>Y/Z Chemical substances</b>, where classes are traditionally designated by a plural term (e.g., <b>protists</b>, <b>aldehydes</b>).  Other exceptions are expressions that are commonly used in the plural, such as <b>fetal alcohol effects</b>, or that otherwise make more sense or sound more natural in the plural.<p>

<b>Use of hyphens</b>.  Hyphens are usually omitted�even where required by normal usage�in order to avoid complications when entering search terms. <P>
 

<center>                          <h2>Thesaurus Format</H2></center>
<p>
The AOD Thesaurus is arranged like a book in three parts: successively detailed tables of contents� the <i>Broad and Detailed Outlines</i> and the <i>Quick Hierarchy</i> following the introduction (Volume 1); a systematically arranged main body of information�the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> (Volume 2); and the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> (Volume 3).  In addition, the <i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i> (Volume 4) is provided. The facing page shows the relationship between the parts of the Thesaurus and the information provided in each.  The figure at the bottom of this page shows an excerpt from the <i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i>.  More detailed explanations and sample pages follow.<P>

<center>
<h2>Orientation and Navigation in the AOD Thesaurus</h2></center>

To get a feel for the organization of the Thesaurus' wide-ranging subject matter, start with the <i>Broad Outline</i> and/or one of the <i>Orientation Maps</i> on pp. viii-x.  Then get an increasingly detailed look by perusing sections of interest in the <i>Detailed Outline</i> and the <i>Quick Hierarchy</i> and finally by reviewing the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> with its scope notes and cross-references that link all the subjects together.<p>

Navigation in the Thesaurus to find descriptors for indexing and searching can start with a general idea of a subject area or with a specific term.  To go from a general idea to a specific concept, the user might follow the systematic stepwise refinement strategy discussed above, or he or she might just scan the tabs in the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> and delve directly into it; familiarity with the hierarchy comes with experience.  In the <i>Annotated Hierarchy,</i> read the scope note and the cross-references, which may lead to additional or more suitable descriptors.  If you have a specific term in mind, you can look it up in the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> and follow the term number given there into the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> to see the hierarchical context and the full body of information.  Alternatively, you can consult the <i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i>; however, keep in mind two things: The <i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i> does not provide the hierarchical context; you cannot quickly see the scope note for a broader or near-by descriptor.  Also, the <i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i> shows a term in only one place, whereas the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> shows a term under each of its constituent words.  For example, secondary prevention will appear only under <i>secondary</i> in the <i>Annotated Alphabetical List,</i> whereas in the <i>Alphabetical Index,</i> it will appear under <i>secondary</i> and <i>prevention.</i>



<h2><center>Volume 2: Annotated Hierarchy</center></h2>
<p>The <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> shows all descriptors in a
logical arrangement and provides a considerable amount of
information for many of them (for examples, see the facing page
and the two following pages).  Each descriptor has a term number
that identifies its home location in the hierarchy; these numbers
allow the user to quickly locate a descriptor in the hierarchy. 
When a descriptor has two or more broader descriptors (such as
<b>GQ10.2 alcoholic liver disorder</b> with the broader
descriptors <b>GQ10 liver disorder</b> and <b>GE6 alcohol related
disorder</b>), one is selected as the home location.  The home
location determines the descriptor's term number; in the example,
<b>alcoholic liver disorder</b> is listed under <b>GQ10</b> with
the term number <b>GQ10.2</b>.  Under the other broader
descriptor, <b>GE6</b>, is a narrower term cross-reference to
<b>GQ10.2</b>.  Thus, a descriptor is never assigned more than
one term number (unlike MESH, which assigns multiple term numbers
to the same descriptor, one number for each descriptor placement
in the hierarchy).  Only a subset of descriptors is used in the
ETOH database; ETOH descriptors are identified through a
subscript "e" after the term number: <b>GQ10.2e</b>.
<p>
Term numbers are printed to the left. Descriptors are printed to the right, with the hierarchical level expressed through typography and arrangement as follows:<p>
<ul>
<dl>
<dt>Level 0 and level 1: 
	<dd>left edge of the descriptor column, large bold<br>
<dt>Level 2:
	<dd>left edge of the descriptor column, regular size bold
<dt> Level 3 through 13:
	<dd>indented, level shown by dots. Level 3 one dot, level 4 two dots, etc.</dl></ul><p>
In cases where the hierarchy is very deep, these typographical rules were adjusted for readability. The hierarchical level can always be seen from the <i>Detailed Outline</i> in Volume 1 or at the beginning of each major section in Volume 2.<p>
To preserve the continuity of the hierarchy, left pages repeat, in italics, the hierarchical chain (starting from level 2) leading to the first descriptor on the page. (The running heads show levels 0 and 1.)<p>

Scope notes (SN) give definitions and explanations of descriptor
usage or of the hierarchical structure.  Synonymous terms (ST,
including quasi-synonyms) further clarify the scope of the
descriptor.  Broader term (BT) cross-references indicate other
places in the hierarchy where the descriptor would logically fit;
conversely, narrower term (NT) cross-references indicate
additional narrower descriptors that have their home location
elsewhere.  (To conserve space, cross-references are shown only
one level up or down, respectively.)  Related term (RT) cross-
references point to descriptors that are similar in meaning or
that might be useful for combinations.  In a cross-reference, a +
before the term number means that the descriptor referred to has
narrower descriptors that should be considered.<p>
<center><h3>Further Explanation of Term Numbers</h3></center> 

The major areas of the hierarchy (level 0) are identified by a
capital letter (e.g., <b>J</b>, with gaps for future expansion),
and the major subdivisions (level 1 or further down the
hierarchy) are identified by a second letter (e.g., <b>JB</b>,
<b>JC</b>).  Within a major subdivision, descriptors are then
identified by a number (e.g., <b>JC2</b>, <b>JC4</b>).  Further
down the hierarchy, descriptors are numbered the same way, with a
dot (.) separating the levels (e.g., <b>JC2.2</b>, <b>JC2.4</b>,
or <b>JG12.8.4</b>).  To keep term numbers short, two-letter
combinations for subdivisions are assigned based on importance;
the hierarchical level can vary from 1 to 6.  Thus, <b>term
numbers do not reflect the hierarchical level of a
descriptor.</b>  The hierarchical level can always be seen from
the <i>Detailed Outline</i>.  <b>Term numbers are valid only for
navigation in one edition of the Thesaurus</b>; they may change
from edition to edition.



<CENTER><h2>Volume 3: Alphabetical Index</h2></center>

The <i>Alphabetical Index</i> is a Key Word Out of Context (KWOC)
index that shows a multiword term under each of its constituent
words (except for stop words, such as <i>and</i>, <i>of</i>, and
<i>for</i>). Thus, <b>SO4.2 alcoholic beverage industry</b>
appears under the access words <i>alcoholic</i>, <i>beverage</i>,
and <i>industry</i>; see the facing sample page for an
illustration of the typography and page layout. (The sample page
was constructed to illustrate all features.)
<ul>
<li>       To aid orientation, the first and last access words on the
        page are shown in the upper left and right corners,
        respectively.<p>

<li>       Access words are printed in boldface; they are given in the
        singular.<p>

<li>       Under one access word, all terms containing that word
        (whether singular or plural) are arranged alphabetically.<p>

<li>       Descriptors are printed in regular type and followed by
        their term number, for example,<ul><p>

               drug evaluation  +EE18e</ul><p>

<li>       Terms not used as descriptors (lead-in terms) are printed in
        italics and followed by USE and the number(s) of the
        descriptor(s) to be used, for example,<p>

<ul>               <i>drug evaluation procedures</i>  USE  +EE18.4 (which
               is drug evaluation process)</ul><p>

<li>      A + before a term number indicates that the descriptor
        referred to has narrower terms.  For example, <b>+EE18e drug
        evaluation</b> has the narrower terms <b>+EE18.2 drug
        evaluation criteria</b> and <b>+EE18.4 drug evaluation
        process</b>.  (Reminder: a subscript "e" following the term
        number indicates that the descriptor is used in the ETOH
        database.)<p>

<li>       If an access word is itself a single-word descriptor, it has
        a term number following it; for example,<p>

<ul>               <b>evaluation</b> +RF2.6e</ul><p>

        If the single-word descriptor is plural, this is indicated
        by -s, for example,<p>

<ul>               <b>ether</b> -s ZF6e.</ul><p>

<li>       If an access word is itself a single-word lead-in term, it
        is printed in bold (since it is an access word) italics
        (since it is a lead-in term) and followed by the number for
        the corresponding descriptor, for example,<p>

<ul>               <i><b>ailment</b></i> USE GA2.8.8 </ul><p>

        where <b>GA2.8.8</b> <i></i>is <b>illness</b>.<p>

<li>       Capitalization matters.  For example, <b>pet</b> and
        <b>PET</b> are two different words.  Following the practice
        of most dictionaries, when two words differ only in
        capitalization, the lowercase word comes first.</ul><p>

There are many italicized lead-in terms in the <i>Alphabetical
Index</i> that will lead the user to a descriptor in the
hierarchy where there will be no corresponding synonymous term
(ST) under that descriptor. This indicates that the term was
considered to be too specific for the Thesaurus at this time and
leads to the appropriate broader term.  For example, it was
decided not to use proper names of tests, such as <i>MAST</i> or
the <i>CAGE questionnaire</i>, as descriptors.  However, these terms do appear in the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> and lead to their broader heading, in the example <b>HB6.10.24 alcohol use test</b>. <p>


<center><H2>Volume 4:  Annotated Alphabetical List</h2></center>


The <i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i> is a list of all the terms
in the Thesaurus.  Unlike the <i>Alphabetical Index,</i> which
shows each term under each of its constituent words, the
<i>Annotated Alphabetical List</i> shows each term only once;
thus, <i>drug evaluation</i> appears only under <i>drug</i> and
not also under <i>evaluation</i>.  See the sample column on the
facing page for an illustration of the typography and page
layout. (The sample page was constructed to illustrate all
features.)<UL>

      <LI> To aid orientation, the first and last term on the page are
        shown in the upper left and right corners, respectively.<P>

      <LI> <b>Descriptor entries</b> consist of the descriptor in bold
        followed by the term number and, if applicable, a scope note
        and cross-references.  Since the <i>Annotated Alphabetical
        List</i> does not provide the hierarchical context, it must
        show <b>all</b> broader term and narrower term cross-
        references.  (To save space, cross-references are shown only
        one level up or down, respectively.)  A + in before a term
        number indicates that the descriptor has narrower
        descriptors that should be considered.<P>

      <LI> <b>Nondescriptor entries</b> consist of the term followed by
        a USE instruction indicating the descriptor(s) to be used. 
        The USE instruction also indicates whether the descriptor is
        broader than the nondescriptor or a synonym of the
        nondescriptor.<P>

      <LI>A + before a term number indicates that the descriptor
        referred to has narrower terms.  For example, from
        <b>evaluation</b> there is a narrower term cross-reference
        to <b>+EE18e drug evaluation</b>, which in turn has the
        narrower terms <b>+EE18.2 drug evaluation criteria</b> and
        <b>+EE18.4 drug evaluation process</b>.  (Reminder: a
        subscript "e" following the term number indicates that the
        descriptor is used in the ETOH database.)<P>

      <LI>Capitalization matters.  For example, <b>pet</b> and
        <b>PET</b> are two different words.  Following the practice
        of most dictionaries, when two words differ only in
        capitalization, the lowercase word comes first.<p>

       <center><h2>Changes in the Second Edition</h2></center>

<p>This second edition was revised with the benefit of substantial indexing
and searching experience.   Descriptors were added to accommodate new
concepts and headings in restructured hierarchies; descriptors were changed
to update a term to a more accepted form or to more accurately reflect the
descriptors specific meaning; descriptors for concepts that are very specific
and/or can be expressed easily as a combination were deleted to control for
size and increase the clarity of the hierarchies; the structure was improved;
and many scope notes and relationships were added.  A few examples of
changes are: The descriptor <b>J2.2 health services research</b> was added with an extensive scope note.  The areas <b>EF route of administration</b>
and <b>FL6 conditioning</b> were restructured and the descriptors were
carefully explained through scope notes.  <i>Physically handicapped</i> was
changed to the updated term <b>TK4.4.4e physically disabled</b>,
<i>regulation</i> was changed to <b>MN12.6 legal regulation</b> to help
differentiate it from <b>EA6 biological regulation</b>.  Many disease concepts
that combine a pathologic process with a body part (e.g., <b>breast
cancer</b>) were deleted.

<center><h2>
USING THE AOD THESAURUS</h2></center>




<center><h2>Navigating the AOD Thesaurus</h2></center>

<p>A search for a suitable descriptor can start in any part of
the AOD Thesaurus.  For instance, you can start with a particular
term you have in mind and look it up in the <i>Alphabetical
Index</i> to find the term number that leads to the descriptor in
the <i>Annotated Hierarchy.</i>  The <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i>
provides the hierarchical context and more information about the
descriptor.  On the other hand, if you have only a general idea
or a limited knowledge of the search topic and cannot pinpoint a
particular term,  you may want to start with the <i>Broad
Outline</i> to locate the general subject area, proceed to the
<i>Detailed Outline</i> to pinpoint the area more closely, then
browse the more specific area in the <i>Quick Hierarchy</i> to
find descriptors, and finally consult the <i>Annotated
Hierarchy</i> for scope notes and relationship information.  A
user familiar with the hierarchy will often look directly on the
appropriate place in the <i>Quick Hierarchy</i> or the
<i>Annotated hierarchy</i>.
<p>The hierarchical organization of the AOD Thesaurus allows for
easy comparison of scope notes and other information for
descriptors that are proximate to one another within the
hierarchy.  The hierarchical organization also suggests further
avenues of searching and enables searchers to deal with topics
with which they are not familiar.
<p>The broader term (BT), narrower term (NT), and related term
(RT) cross-references provide important leads to other
descriptors that should be considered instead of or in addition
to the descriptor found first; they are an invaluable aid to
navigation in the Thesaurus.
<P>


Scope notes and related term cross-references have "hierarchical
force", they apply to the descriptors down the hierarchy as well. 
The box below provides an example.

Consider this excerpt from the hierarchy:

<b>JU4</b>e<b>                health care planning</b>
                                  <h4>RT +MQ8 program planning,
                                  implementation, and evaluation</h4>
JU4.2                     .       national health care planning
JU4.4                     .       regional health care planning
JU4.6                     .       health services coordination

The RT cross-reference suggests that <b>MQ8</b> (or one of its
narrower terms, such as <b>MQ8.10e program evaluation</b>)
might be useful in combination with <b>JU4</b>.  By
hierarchical force, this suggestion holds also for
<b>JU4.2</b>, <b>JU4.4</b>, and <b>JU4.6</b>.  Thus, a user
considering the descriptor <b>JU4.4 regional health care
planning</b> should also consult the cross-references under the
broader descriptor <b>JU4</b>.
The examples on the facing page and the further examples under
indexing and under searching show techniques for navigating the
Thesaurus and illustrate how the different parts of the AOD
Thesaurus complement each other.  They also show the use of
browsing up or down the hierarchy for finding broader or narrower
descriptors as appropriate.<P>

<H2><center>Navigation Example 1</center></H2>


<p>Topic:  <i><b>drug policy in Western Europe versus the
United States</b></i>
<p>Search the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> under the access word
<i>policy</i>, browse the list of terms, and find
<p>             <b>public policy on illicit drugs MP16.2.6</b>
                
In the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> find <b>MP16.2.6 public
policy on illicit drugs </b>with a scope note and two related
terms: <b>MN20.10 drug laws</b> and <b>MP16.2.8.4 war on
drugs</b>. <b></b>
<p>Continue browsing the public policy area and note
<b>MP16.2.8 AOD public policy strategy</b>, including
<b>MP16.2.8.2 zero-tolerance</b>, <b>MP16.2.8.8 supply
reduction policy</b>, <b></b>etc.
<p>Now look in the <i>Detailed Outline</i> under <b>VA
Place</b> and find <b>VD United States</b> and
<b>VH Europe</b>. Turn to <b>VH Europe</b> in the <i>Annotated
Hierarchy</i> and find <b>VH4 Western Europe</b> with all the
countries of Western Europe listed under the term.

 <center>     <h2>Navigation Example 2</h2></center> 


<p>Topic:  <i><b>teratogenesis of ethanol</b></i>
<p>First search the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> for teratogenesis
and for ethanol and find
<p>     <b>chemical teratogenesis GJ2.14.2.</b>
<p>     <b>ethanol BB2</b>
<p>The most obvious query is <b>chemical teratogenesis</b>  AND 
<b>ethanol</b>.
<p>To refine the query, look in the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i>
for <b>GJ2.14.2 chemical teratogenesis</b>; note the
cross-reference
<p>     <b>RT +EE20.4 prenatal chemical exposure</b>
                
which may be of interest for additional indexing or for expanding
the query.  However, following the RT cross-reference to
<b>EE20.4</b> and browsing the narrower terms (indicated by +),
you find 
<b></b>
        <b>EE20.4.2.2 prenatal alcohol exposure</b> 
<p>which looks like the descriptor to use; however, the scope
note limits it to discussion of the mechanism of exposure and
refers to <b>GJ2.16.2.2 fetal alcohol effects</b> for a
discussion of effects.
<p>A more specific query for this topic is
<p>     <b>chemical teratogenesis</b>  AND  <b>fetal alcohol
        effects</b>
<p>To be on the safe side, include <b>prenatal alcohol
exposure</b> in the query to catch documents that discuss
primarily the mechanism of exposure with only passing mention of
teratogenic effects.<P>



<center><h2>Indexing and Cataloging With the AOD Thesaurus</h2></center>



<p>Through its hierarchical organization and its rich network and
relationships that capture the concepts of interest in the field,
the thesaurus supports request-oriented or user-centered
indexing.  It helps the indexer to analyze a document from the
user's perspective and identify the descriptors under which the
document should be found in a search and under which it should
therefore be indexed.  After examining a document and assigning
descriptors suggested by it, the indexer might mentally review
the hierarchal structure or follow cross-references to identify
less obvious descriptors under which the document should be
found.  For example, a document dealing with an incident
involving a misleading label on an alcoholic beverage should
obviously be indexed by <b>MN26.2.6 product label regulation</b>. 
This descriptor has a related term cross-reference reminding the
indexer also to consider <b>MS2.8 corporate responsibility</b>,
which, depending on the document and on the interests of the
library's users, <b></b>might be an important descriptor for the
document.  
<p>Each library, information center, or database producer will
use its own indexing rules suited to the needs of its users.  In
particular, each organization must decide to what level of
specificity it wishes to index. This decision will depend
primarily on the size of the center's collection, the interest of
its users, and the focus of the collection.  The Thesaurus is
highly specific in many areas; any given organization may need
that specificity in some areas but not in others.
<p>The examples given illustrate one approach to indexing with
the Thesaurus using navigation in the Thesaurus structure.  Other
approaches are possible.  When reading these examples, keep in
mind that as the indexers gain experience with the Thesaurus,
they will internalize essential parts of the structure and know
where to find frequently used descriptors, speeding up the
process considerably.<P>

The structure of the <i>AOD Thesaurus</i> is geared toward
indexing by combining concepts freely in indexing (and
searching).  As discussed in the section <i>Function and
Structure of the Thesaurus</i>, the descriptors in the Thesaurus
represent mostly elemental concepts, and many additional concepts
can and must be expressed through a combination of descriptors;
for example,<UL>

        <i>nicotine craving</i> is <b>AE6 AOD craving</b> combined
        with <b>BB2 ethanol</b><P>

        <i>lung cancer</i> is <b>GG20.26 neoplastic disease
        </b>combined with <b>XK4 lung</b></UL><P>

An individual system may represent the indexing of a document as
a simple list of elemental descriptors; another system may group
elemental descriptors into linked "subject phrases," each subject
phrase representing a compound concept formed by a descriptor
combination, such as

      <UL><b>AOD craving : ethanol</b></UL>


<b>The <i>AOD Thesaurus</i> as a basis for shelf classification. 
</b>The Thesaurus is designed for indexing documents with
multiple descriptors at a high level of specificity; the
arrangement of books on shelves poses different requirements. 
However, the Thesaurus could be used to construct a shelf
classification.  A library could use the broad drug classes from
section <b>B AOD substance or product</b> as the major principle
of subdivision and then further subdivide by fairly broad
concepts from section <b>A AOD use, abuse, and dependence</b>. 
The library would need to devise a system of brief notations
suitable for call numbers.  Libraries often have different
requirements for arranging books on shelves depending on the
interests of their users.  Using the Thesaurus as the basis for
constructing such classifications would save work in creating
such classifications and promote conceptual consistency among
them.<P>

                                       <center><H2>Indexing Example 1</h2></center>
<p>Topic of article to be indexed:  <b><i>alcohol-related
effects on neuronal structure</b></i>
<p>First work on alcohol-related effects.  You might remember
that there is a section <b>AL AOD effects and AODR problems</b>
and look it up in the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> to find <b>AM2
AODE</b>.  Or you could look under either <i>alcohol</i> or
<i>effect</i> in the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> and find
<i>alcohol effect</i> with the instruction to USE <b>+AM2</b>
and <b>BB2</b>, which are <b>AM2 AODE</b> and <b>BB2
ethanol</b>.  Check the narrower descriptors <b>AM2.2
psychobehavioral AODE</b> and <b>AM2.4 other physiological
AODE</b>; since the article deals with motor neurons,
<b>AM2.4</b> might be more appropriate, but if in doubt use
<b>AM2</b>.  There are two more narrower terms, <b>AM2.6 acute
AODE</b> and <b>AM2.8 chronic AODE</b>; the article does not
make clear which is studied, so you cannot assign one of these
descriptors.
<p>Next work on <i>neuron</i> or <i>neuronal</i>, looking them
up in the <i>Alphabetical Index.</i>  Under the access word
<i>neuron</i> find
<p>     neuron structure +XX2.2.2e
<p>(The access word <i>neuronal</i> would yield <i>neuronal
ultrastructure</i> USE <b>+XX2.2.2e</b>)
                
Go to the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> to <b>XX2.2.2 neuron
structure</b>.  Under this term, find descriptors for cell
structures intrinsic to neurons, any of which may be more
appropriate for indexing the document at hand, for example
<p>     <b>XX2.2.2.4e dendrite</b>  or  <b>XX2.2.2.6.8
        nonmyelinated axon</b>
<p>Browsing in the general area, find <b>XX2.2.4 neuron
type</b> and, under that, <b>XX2.2.4.4.2 motor neuron</b>,
which applies to the document.  You also find <b>XX4e neural
tissue</b> with narrower terms, but none of them apply.  From
<b>neuron structure</b> there is also a cross-reference NT
<b>+XX4.2 sensory receptors</b>, a useful cross-reference were
the document to focus on sensory neurons.
<p>Final indexing descriptors:
<p>   <b>AM2.4                  other physiological AODE
</b>         <b>BB2</b>                      <b>ethanol</b>
<b>   XX2.2.4.4.2               motor neuron</b>

<UL> Although many disorders, such as psychiatric
                   illnesses, including alcoholism and substance
                   addiction, are known to aggregate within families,
                   their transmission and the interaction of
                   environmental factors with inborn traits are still
                   unknown. While proof of genetic causation of
                   addiction is not necessary to validate the concept of
                   addiction as a disease process, by learning more
                   about the inheritance of vulnerability to addiction,
                   clinicians are expected to define it more accurately,
                   to subdivide addiction, and eventually to devise more
                   effective means of treatment.</UL><P>

<p>The central theme of this document is the definition and cause
of drug addiction.  As an indexer with a little experience, you
will know to look in section <b>A AOD use</b>, <b>abuse and
dependence</b>; turning to the <i>Annotated Hierarchy and
</i>browsing the detailed outline in the front of section
<b>A</b> yields two relevant headings
<ul>   <b>AJ theory of AODU</b><BR>
<p>   <b>AK causes of AODU</b></UL>
<P>
Browsing the hierarchy you note that the document would be of
interest in a search for <b>AJ4.2 disease theory</b> or for
<b>AJ4.8 genetic theory</b> (both under <b>AJ4 biological AOD use
disorder theory</b>).  Under <b>AJ4.2</b> is an RT cross-
reference to <b>GA4.6 disorder classification</b>; it or its
neighbor <b>GA4.2 disorder definition</b> should perhaps be used
for this document, but <b>AJ4.2</b> seems sufficient.  Further
browsing leads to <b>AJ10 sociocultural AOD use disorder
theory</b>, another descriptor under which this document should
be found.  From <b>AJ10</b> is an RT cross-reference to <b>EX14
hereditary vs environmental factors</b>, which seems very
relevant; checking it out in section <b>E</b> (particularly the
scope note for <b>EX14.2 hereditary factors</b>), you find that
<b>EX14</b> rather than <b>EY heredity</b> is the correct
descriptor here.  An examination of the descriptors under
<b>AK</b> shows that for the most part the theory descriptors
assigned are more appropriate.  (In any event, for a
comprehensive search, the searcher should look under both
<b>AJ</b> and <b>AK</b>.)  But it appears that the document
should be found under <b>AK2 multiple AODC</b>.

<p>Turning now to the <i>addiction</i> concept, you could look in
the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> and find
<p>  <UL>   <i>drug addiction</i>  USE +GC6</UL><P>
<p>Look up <b>GC6</b> in the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> to find the preferred term
<p>   <UL>  <b>GC6 AOD dependence</b></UL>
<p>Alternatively, you could browse section <b>AA nature of
AODU</b>, find <b>AA2.4.4 AOD misuse</b> with an NT cross-
reference to <b>GC6 AOD dependence</b>.
<p>Browsing the <b>GC</b> area yields another relevant
descriptor, <b>GC8.10 familial alcoholism</b>. 
<p><b></b>
                                                                                      
<p>
Indexing rules may require that <b>GC6 AOD dependence</b> be
always combined with a substance descriptor; look <i></i>in
section <b>B</b><b> AOD substance or product</b>.  The descriptor
appropriate for this document is
<p>     <UL><b>BA AOD substances in general</b></UL>
<p>Finally consider the type of study used or discussed.  The
title indicates <i>family and adoption studies</i>.  Turning
directly to section <b>RC research and evaluation methods</b> or
through the alphabetical index find
<p>  <UL>  <b>RJ8.2.4 adoption study</b>  and<P>
<p>     <b>RJ8.4 family study</b></UL>
<p>To explore the <i>family</i> theme further, look in the
<i>Alphabetical Index</i> under <i>family</i>.  <i></i>Note that
many family-related concepts are found in the hierarchy
<p>    <UL> <b>+LG family and kinship</b></UL>
<p>Turn to this section and browse the hierarchy for suitable
descriptor(s), e.g.,
<p>  <UL>   <b>LG22 family environment</b>; also <b>LG24 family
        relations</b></UL>
                
Under <b>LG24 family relations</b>, note the cross-reference
<p>     <UL><b>RT +TW2 status by family relationship</b></UL>
<p>Following this cross-reference yields the narrower term
<p>    <UL> <b>TW2.2 type of family relation</b></UL>

Because the article discusses the type of family relationship
rather than the dynamics of the relationship, the descriptor
<b>TW2.2</b> is the more appropriate.  (Incidentally, looking
under the nearby access word <i>familial</i> would also lead to
<b>GC8.10 familial alcoholism</b>.)

<center><h2>Searching With the AOD Thesaurus</h2></center>
<center><h3>Searching ETOH and the NCADI Databases With the AOD
Thesaurus</h3></center>
The NIAAA's Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database
(known as ETOH) and the databases maintained by NCADI are indexed
with the AOD Thesaurus.  The examples included in the sections on
navigation and on indexing illustrate efficient ways for locating
suitable descriptors in the Thesaurus.
<p><b>ETOH Descriptors and Searching ETOH</b>.  Because the AOD
Thesaurus extends beyond the scope of alcohol research, not all
Thesaurus descriptors are necessary for the indexing of ETOH. 
Therefore, each descriptor in the Thesaurus has been carefully
considered for designation as an ETOH indexing term.  These
descriptors are marked by a subscript "e" to the right of the
term number, for example, <b>FD4e AOD personality</b>.  This
designation appears in all parts of the Thesaurus.  On Ovid
Technology's system, these <b>ETOH descriptors</b> can be
searched in the fields MJ (major descriptor) and MN (minor
descriptor).  <i>AOD Thesaurus</i> descriptors not selected as
ETOH descriptors may have been placed in the ID (identifier)
field and can be searched in this field.  In addition,
descriptor-based searching of ETOH can always be supplemented
with free-text searching of title, abstract, and assigned terms.
<p><b>Searching NCADI Databases</b>.  The NCADI databases are
indexed with the AOD Thesaurus.  For information about searching
these databases, <b></b>contact NCADI. 



<p>The AOD Thesaurus provides terms and relationships between and
among terms that searchers will find valuable in free-text
searching in any database.  For example, a user interested in the
effects of a particular AOD substance on consciousness will find
in the <i>Detailed Outline</i> in the section <b>FA
psychology</b> the heading <b>FF state of consciousness</b>. 
Consulting the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> under that heading
yields narrower terms describing various states of consciousness,
such as <b>attention</b>, <b>wakefulness</b>, and <b>sleep</b>,
together with cross-references to related terms, providing the
user with more detailed terminology that will serve in searching
across databases.  The Thesaurus also provides a plethora of
synonyms; for example, the descriptor <b>FF2.2.8.2 REM sleep</b>
has five synonyms: <i>active eye movement sleep</i>; <i>active
sleep</i>; <i>desynchronized sleep</i>; <i>dream sleep</i>; and,
of course, its full term, <i>rapid eye movement sleep</i>. This
enables the searcher to conduct a thorough free-text search with
the expression
<p>     REM sleep OR active eye movement sleep OR active sleep OR
        desynchronized sleep OR dream sleep OR rapid eye movement
        sleep
<p><b>NOTE: </b>The way in which multiword terms are entered
depends on the proximity commands of the database system used.
For example, the term <i>active sleep</i> may require any of the
following forms:
<p>   
<ul>  <i>active <b>with</b> sleep </i>or <br>
<p>     <i>active <b>adj</b> sleep</i><p></ul><p>
 The following examples illustrate the use of the Thesaurus in searching, example 1 for descriptor-based searching and example 2 for free-text searching. <p>

<center> <h2>Search Example 1:  Using Thesaurus Descriptors</h2></center>

<p>Search topic:  <i><b>impact of price and advertising on
tobacco consumption</b></i>
<p>First work on the basic concept, tobacco consumption.  Browse
the section <b>B AOD substance or product </b>until finding the
drug
<p>     <b>BD tobacco in any form</b>
<p>To identify the proper descriptor for consumption, look in the
<i>Alphabetical Index</i> and find
<p>     <b>AOD consumption AD8.4</b>
<p>Turn to the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> under <b>AD8.4</b>;
there is a related term <b>+MT6.8.4.2.2 AOD sales</b>; this
descriptor will prove useful should the search need broadening. 
(In this example, there is actually a narrower precombined
descriptor <b>MT6.8.4.2.2.4 tobacco sales</b>, but we will ignore
it here to keep the example simple.) 
<p>To find price, you could browse around in the <b>MT6</b> area
of the economics section (since you are already there) or you
could look in the <i>Alphabetical Index</i> under <i>price</i>;
either way, you find
<p>     <b>AOD price MT6.12.4.2
</b>
In the <i>Annotated Hierarchy,</i> under <b>MT6.12.4.2 AOD
price</b> there is a related term cross-reference to <b>MT22.4.4
sales and excise tax</b>, a tax that is applied to tobacco and
impacts on the price and may thus be useful in expanding the
search.
<p>You can now put together the <b>first subquery</b>:

<table>
<tr><th align=left>tobacco in any form</th><th>AND AOD consumption</th><th align=right>AND AOD price</th></tr>
</table>

<p>     <b>tobacco in any form</b>                      AND     <b>AOD consumption</b>
                                                                        AND     <b>AOD
                                                                                price</b>
                                                      OR                                     OR
                                                <b>AOD sales</b>                                <b>sales    and  excise tax</b>
                                                                                               
<p>Now work on the advertising concept.  Browsing the <i>Detailed
Outline</i>, <b>L social sciences</b> yields<ul>
<p>     <b>MR marketing and public relations</b></ul>

<p>Go to this section of the <i>Annotated Hierarchy</i> and scan
the hierarchy to find <b>MR6 advertising</b> and under it
<b>MR6.2 AOD product advertising</b>.  Following the hierarchy
further down, <p>
<ul>
<p>     <b>MR6.2.8 AOD advertising impact</b></ul>

<p><b></b>which shows a broader term <b>MR6.12 advertising
effect</b> that may be of use in broadening the search.
<p>
The <b>second subquery</b> thus becomes
<p>
<ul>     <b>tobacco in any form</b>                      AND     <b>AOD consumption</b>
                                                                        AND     <b>AOD

                                     advertising effect)

</ul><p>It also might be useful to broaden the search by using <b>MT6
fundamental macroeconomic concepts</b> instead of the narrower
<b>price</b>.  The hierarchy helps in finding such broader
descriptors and, more generally, in thinking about the
ramifications of a search topic.<P>

        (<b>self help</b> OR <b>self improvement</b> OR <b>mutual
        support</b> OR <b>skills</b>)
                        AND
        <b>parent</b>           (in free-text searching, parent searched with

                                parenting skills, etc.)
                        AND

        (<b>AOD</b> OR <b>ATOD</b> OR <b>drug</b> OR
        <b>substance</b> OR <b>chemical</b> OR <b>alcohol</b>)

        In a search variation, replace the last two lines by

        (<b>addiction</b>  OR  <b>high risk</b>)

        To broaden the query, use (<b>parent</b>  OR 
        <b>family</b>), and/or add specific drug terms (found in the
        <i>Annotated Hierarchy,</i> section <b>B AOD substance or
        product</b>) to the OR expression, and/or omit an AND
        component, especially the last one.
